# lx32

lx32 is a minimal 32-bit CPU project written in SystemVerilog.

The goal of this project is educational: to understand how a CPU works from the ground up, including digital logic, datapaths, control logic, and basic instruction execution.

## Goals
- Learn computer architecture by building it
- Practice SystemVerilog through real hardware design
- Keep the design simple, readable, and well-documented

## Non-Goals
- High performance
- Feature completeness
- Production-ready silicon

## Project Scope
- Custom 32-bit architecture
- Simple instruction set
- Incremental development and testing
- Simulation-first approach

##  Verification & Robustness

The LX32 architecture undergoes massive stress testing via a custom **Rust-based validator**.

| Module | Iterations | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **ALU Core** | 100,000,000 | ✅ PASSED |
| **Branch Unit** | 100,000,000 | ✅ PASSED |
| **Control Unit** | 100,000,000 | ✅ PASSED |
| **Register File** | 100,000,000 | ✅ PASSED |
| **Full System** | 100,000,000 | ✅ PASSED |

**Total random vectors processed:** ~900 Million in < 70s.
