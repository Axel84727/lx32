# lx32

lx32 is a minimal 32-bit CPU project written in SystemVerilog.

The goal of this project is educational: to understand how a CPU works from the ground up, including digital logic, datapaths, control logic, and basic instruction execution.

## Goals
- Learn computer architecture by building it
- Practice SystemVerilog through real hardware design
- Keep the design simple, readable, and well-documented

## Non-Goals
- High performance
- Feature completeness
- Production-ready silicon

## Project Scope
- Custom 32-bit architecture
- Simple instruction set
- Incremental development and testing
- Simulation-first approach
